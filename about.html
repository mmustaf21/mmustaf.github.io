        <h1>About Mohamed Mustaf</h1>
        <p>My name is Mohamed Mustaf. I was born in April 2004. I love to play soccer and video games. Currently, I am enrolled at KSU for Cybersecurity, and I'm enjoying my time there. One surprising fact about me is that I am one of nine siblings. In academics, my strengths lie in my work ethic and ability to understand things at a fast pace. I absorb knowledge like a sponge and produce results. I am currently enrolled in Testout (like a scholarship program) for Cybersecurity where I am honing and improving my skills in writing code, and improving security.</p>
